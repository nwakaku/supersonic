## **🔹 SuperSonic: Where YOU can talk to your own personalized blockchain assistant. (Retell AI + ZerePy)**  

### **🚀 Inspiration**  
Access to financial services remains a global challenge, with **1.7 billion people still unbanked**. Traditional banking requires internet access, digital literacy, and physical infrastructure—barriers that exclude many underserved populations.  

Inspired by **Web3, AI, and decentralization**, we envisioned **SuperSonic**, a **voice-first, web3 assistant**. By leveraging **Retell AI for conversational AI** and **ZerePy for Blockchain activities**, SuperSonic enables **borderless, trustless, and inclusive finance** for everyone—**no smartphone, internet required nor blockchain knowledge**.
